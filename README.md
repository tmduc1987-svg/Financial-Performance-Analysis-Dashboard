# Project Overview

This project involved designing an interactive Power BI dashboard using a financial sample dataset to analyse sales performance, profitability, and business trends across products, segments, regions, and time. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify performance drivers, monitor key metrics, and support data-driven decision-making.

# Problem Statement

Business stakeholders lacked a consolidated and visual way to understand financial performance across multiple dimensions such as product, market segment, geography, and time. Existing data was available in tabular format but did not provide clear insights into profitability trends, growth opportunities, or underperforming areas.

# Business Objective

The objective of this project was to:

- Transform raw financial data into meaningful insights

- Provide a high-level view of sales, profit, and cost performance

- Enable users to identify trends, variances, and key contributors to financial results

- Support strategic and operational decision-making through interactive reporting

# What I Built

I developed an interactive Power BI report featuring:

- Key financial KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Discounts

- Trend analysis over time to track performance changes

- Breakdown of financial performance by product, segment, country, and region

- Visual comparisons to highlight top-performing and underperforming categories

- Slicers and filters to allow users to dynamically explore the data

The report was designed with a clear layout, consistent formatting, and user-friendly navigation to ensure insights are easily accessible.

# Outcomes & Insights

The dashboard provided clear insights into:

- Which products and segments generate the highest revenue and profit

- Regional and country-level performance differences

- The impact of discounts on profitability

- Seasonal or time-based trends affecting sales and profit

- Areas where costs or discounting may be eroding margins

These insights help stakeholders focus on high-value opportunities, improve pricing or discount strategies, and monitor overall financial health.
